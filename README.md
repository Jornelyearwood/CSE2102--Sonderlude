GENERAL INFORMATION

This database dubbed the Inmate Management Information System (IMIS) is necessary 
for the smooth and efficient management of the Two Thousand plus (2000+) criminal 
population incarcerated within five (5) locations managed by the Guyana Prison Service (GPS). 
The IMIS will replace the current inefficient paper based system that are prone to mistakes, 
and will provide faster reporting and information retrieval as well as more precise data management. 

-- PROBLEM STATEMENT

The Guyana Prison Service has five (5) locations across Guyana, three (3) of which are
admission prisons that is Prisons that are mandated to admit and discharge inmates. 
The GPS is responsible for some Two Thousand (2000) plus inmates, whose entire stay 
within the penal system must be carefully and minutely managed and monitored. 
	These inmates are classified in several different ways, first by their criminal 
status, that is; Remand (un-convicted inmates that are before the magistrate court) or 
Convicted (inmates who have been found guilty and sentenced). These are further broken down,
Remand can be further classified as Committed (inmates who have been committed to stand trial
before a jury of their peers) and Convicted can also be classified as Condemn (inmates who 
are sentenced to death) and Appellants (inmates who have been sentenced and have petitioned 
the appeal court to retry their case and/or cases). They are then further profiled by the 
nature and circumstances of their crime, and if they had previous criminal records. 
	At this point the management of inmates is done using their penal records (physical paper) 
and journals (specially designed and ledgers). The current system is prone to inconsistencies, 
human errors and physical damage, being misplaced and seemingly incomplete interviews. 
	This completely manual paper system is very tedious and troublesome to collate on a 
monthly and annual basis to generate reports. Also it is quite time consuming and redundant,
especially when special reports are requested by outside entities and invested shareholders.
 Hence there is an urgent need for a database management system to be completed and implemented 
to handle the management of inmates throughout their prison career. The GPS would like special 
emphasis on the tracking of Admission, Discharge, Transfers, Visits, Court Proceedings, and 
Altercations/Disciplinary Matters. 

-- PURPOSE
This Database requirement document will give an in depth view of the Model used to effectively 
design a support the functional requirements of the Inmate Management Information System with 
specific references to system performance specification. It will explain the purpose of the 
database as it relates to the application model taking into consideration the logical and 
physical aspects. It will outline the usage of tables, requirements and other considerations, 
while explaining the integration of the two components of the system that of the web application 
and the database.

-- SCOPE

This project will focus exclusively on the inmates and their direct management, that is their 
admission, discharge, transfers, discipline, medical and visits.
